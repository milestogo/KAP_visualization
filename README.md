Tools and tables to visualize how much of a camera's field of view will be taken up by an object of a known size. 

This answers the question: At a known elevation and camera inclination, how much of the photo will a car ocupy? 

My expectation is that people will print out the HTML table & use it to train their eye. 
The Table shows horizontal and vertical proportion of the field of view, as well as 
distance from the top and bottom of the field of view  to where an  imaginary plumb bob hanging from the camera would strike the ground.  This may be useful when it is easier to estimate horizontal distance from the camera to the object than the camera altitude.
